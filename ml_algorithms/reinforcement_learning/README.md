# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions. These algorithms are used for decision-making in dynamic environments.

## Algorithms

- [Q-Learning](q_learning.py) - Value-based learning with Q-table
- [Deep Q-Network](deep_q_network.py) - Neural network approximation of Q-values
- [Policy Gradients](policy_gradients.py) - Direct policy optimization
